## License
The **Creature Runtimes** operate under 2 License types depending on whether you own a Licensed copy of [Creature](https://creature.kestrelmoon.com) or not.
- **People who own a licensed copy of Creature:** You use the standard **Creature License** included with the runtime code. **TLDR:** You are free to publish/modify/sell your product with the Creature runtimes without needing to state you are using the runtimes/put the copyright notice in your code/app. If you already have been using the Creature runtimes as a licensed owner of Creature, nothing changes :)

- **Everyone else:** The runtimes are released under the very permissive [**Apache License**](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) :)

***Both Licenses allow for private use and do not require any disclosure of your source code.***
